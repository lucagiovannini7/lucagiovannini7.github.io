</br>
<p>
	I met a traveller from an antique land<br>
	Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
	Stand in the desart. Near them on the sand,<br>
	Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown<br>
	And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command<br>
	Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
	Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,<br>
	The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.<br>
	And on the pedestal these words appear:<br>
	My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:<br>
	Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!<br>
	Nothing beside remains: round the decay<br>
	Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,<br>
	The lone and level sands stretch far away.
</p>

<p>Percy Bysshe Shelley, <i>Ozymandias</i> (1817)</p>
