		<i>
			I met a traveller from an antique land<br>
			Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
			Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,<br>
			Half sunk, a shatter'd visage lies, whose frown<br>
			And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command<br>
			Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
			Which yet survive, stamp'd on these lifeless things,<br>
			The hand that mock'd them and the heart that fed.<br>
			And on the pedestal these words appear:<br>
			My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:<br>
			Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!<br>
			Nothing beside remains: round the decay<br>
			Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,<br>
			The lone and level sands stretch far away.
		</i>
